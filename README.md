# Name's Nix config

A real mess but y'know.

## Installation

No clue, gotta fill in l8r.

## Usage

### Creating a user config

To create a user config you need to create a user folder containing a `home.nix` in the users folder.
This `home.nix` should handle all your user specific configuration, any modules you can share across users should be placed into `modules/home-manager/` otherwise place them wherever you feel.
